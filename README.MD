Hello!


The following project gives you a random set of timezones and that you can choose from.

The range is from 1 to 10 (0,10).


This project was based on a challenge that used datetime and pytz.


Added aspects: 

Randomization - each time you run you get a different timezones

Note: Added random.sample() to avoid possibility of getting the same result. 

Error handling - user has ability to only input int in range from 1 to 10 (0,10)


This was a simple project that did not take a lot of time. 


Hope you enjoy it as much as I did! :)
