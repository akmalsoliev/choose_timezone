Hello!

The following project gives you a random set of timezones and that you can choose from.
The range is from 1 to 10 (0,10).

This project was based on a challenge that was based around datetime and pytz.

Added aspects: 
Randomization - each time you run you get a different timezones
Error handling - user has ability to only input int in range from 1 to 10 (0,10)

This was a simple project that did not take a lot of time. 

Hope you enjoy it as much as I did! :)
